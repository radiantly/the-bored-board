# The Bored Board

I've always been fascinated by having tons of clickable thumbnails on a single site, so this was a quick weekend hack that showcased a prototype of what I'd been thinking of. Some takeaways from this project:

- Has to be appealing to the eye. Site design needs to improve.
- Can we have a zoom feature? And add more sites.
- Speaking of increasing the site count, this project has links to 180+ sites, but curating is difficult. How would one build an auto-curator?

Personally, I feel this project is definitely worth a revisit, but I will be archiving it for now.

Built with React and Next.js
